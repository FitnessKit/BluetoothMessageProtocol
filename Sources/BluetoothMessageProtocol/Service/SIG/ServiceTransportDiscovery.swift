/// BLE Transport Discovery Service
///
/// This service enables a device using Bluetooth low energy wireless technology
/// to expose services that are available on a transport other than Bluetooth low
/// energy. When used together with a higher level specification (e.g., a
/// specification which references and makes use of TDS), the information provided
/// by this service can be used to facilitate discovery and utilization of BR/EDR
/// or transports not defined by the Bluetooth SIG such as those defined by the
/// Wi-Fi AllianceÂ® or other organizations.
